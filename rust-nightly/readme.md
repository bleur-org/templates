# Nightly Rust Nix Template

This is a starter pack for Nix friendly Rust project with nightly ecosystem provided to you by [Bleur Stack]
members. The project uses fenix to fetch nightly rust toolchain from rustup catalogue and unfortunately, it fetches
and patches once (untill you clean cache) the whole rustup toolchain and THEN build the program or run.

> Please, after bootstrapping, rename / change all `example` or `template` keywords in template files.

## Rust Toolchain

Rustup nightly toolchain is utilized and managed by Nix package manager via `rust-toolchain.toml` file which can be
found at the root path of your project. Feel free to modify toolchain file to customize toolchain behaviour.

## Development

The project has `shell.nix` which has development environment preconfigured already for you. Just open your
terminal and at the root of this project:

```bash
# Open in bash by default
nix develop

# If you want other shell
nix develop -c $SHELL

# After entering Nix development environment,
# inside the env, you can open your editor, so
# your editor will read all $PATH and environmental
# variables, also your terminal inside your editor
# will adopt all variables, so, you can close terminal.

# Neovim
vim .

# VSCode
code .

# Zed Editor
zed .
```

The development environment has whatever you may need already, but feel free to add or remove whatever
inside `shell.nix`.

## Building

Well, there are two ways of building your project. You can either go with classic `cargo build` way, but before that, make sure to enter development environment to have cargo and all rust toolchain available in your PATH, you may do like that:

```bash
# Entering development environment
nix develop -c $SHELL

# Compile the project
cargo build --release
```

Or, you can build your project via nix which will do all the dirty work for you. Just, in your terminal:

```bash
# Build in nix environment
nix build

# Executable binary is available at:
./result/bin/template
```

## FAQ

### Why not use default.nix for devShell?

There's been cases when I wanted to reproduce totally different behaviors in development environment and
production build. This occurs quite a lot lately for some reason and because of that, I tend to keep
both shell.nix and default.nix to don't mix things up.

### Error when building or entering development environment

If you see something like that in the end:

```
error: hash mismatch in fixed-output derivation '/nix/store/fsrachja0ig5gijrkbpal1b031lzalf0-channel-rust-stable.toml.drv':
  specified: sha256-vMlz0zHduoXtrlu0Kj1jEp71tYFXyymACW8L4jzrzNA=
     got:    sha256-Hn2uaQzRLidAWpfmRwSRdImifGUCAb9HeAqTYFXWeQk=
```

Just know that something in that version of rustup changed or sha is outdated, so, just copy whatever
shown in `got` and place that in both `default.nix` and `shell.nix` at:

```
  # Rust Toolchain via fenix
  toolchain = fenix.packages.${pkgs.system}.fromToolchainFile {
    file = ./rust-toolchain.toml;

    # Bla bla bla bla bla, bla bla bla.
    #                     REPLACE THIS LONG THING!
    sha256 = "sha256-Hn2uaQzRLidAWpfmRwSRdImifGUCAb9HeAqTYFXWeQk=";
  };
```

### My program can't compile or cargo segfaults

This happens when you use very, very, very latest nightly toolchain. Just go back like, 2 or 3 months back and then
re-enter development environment or build, it should probably work. I resolved that probled like that in my
embedded rust project.
